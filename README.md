# Fresher
\
Fresher is an application that tracks the expiration dates
of items your fridge so that **you** don't have to remember all 
of them. Fresher would allow you to have convenient access to:

- all items in your fridge, separated by category
- items that have expired
- items that will expire in a given timeframe, say 1 week
- a working grocery list that automatically updates when an essential item expires
- search an item's name to see when it expires

Fresher could be useful for anyone that has to keep track of 
food items, whether that be a restaurant with hundreds of 
ingredients or a university student with a mini-fridge. 
I was personally interested in this project because there 
have been too many instances where I started cooking a meal 
only to realize _half-way in_ that I could not finish the 
recipe because one of the ingredients was expired. With an 
application like Fresher, I could quickly check whether I can
follow a recipe or not based on whether I have all the 
necessary ingredients and whether they are still 
safe to eat.
